        <p>This story has a familiar beginning. As with <a href="../../post/2025-03-20-ui-as-code">UI as Code</a>, an innocuous UI request from Dana has
unexpectedly deep consequences. Dana noticed that the Douglas fir image on the <a href="https://imerss.github.io/xetthecum-storymap-story/Xetthecum-Storymap-Reknitted.html">Xetthecum</a> Forest community pane
was no longer showing up&hellip; here is what we see:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/douglas-fir.png" alt="Douglas fir in forest"></p>
<p>The cause in itself is indeed fairly innocuous. We are sourcing these images from iNaturalist&rsquo;s CDN which has been
for many years in the slow process of migrating from URLs like <a href="https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/641410/medium.jpg">https://static.inaturalist.org/photos/641410/medium.jpg</a>
to URLs like <a href="https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/641410/medium.jpg">https://inaturalist-open-data.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/641410/medium.jpg</a>.
The fix should be straightforward – rerunning the data pipeline behind the app will re-scrape the API and update the URL.</p>
<p>However, when we do this, an unrelated and peculiar problem emerges. The entire taxon record behind this
rather attractive fern, <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/52676-Pentagramma-triangularis"><em>Pentagramma triangularis</em></a>
(pictured here) appears to be gone from the app&rsquo;s data and because of this inconsistency the app fails to start up.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/Pentagramma%20triangularis.jpg" alt="Pentagramma triangularis"></p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t entirely unbelievable since in practice taxonomies are gradually shifting all the time, but the circumstances
here are a little odd. To start with, the observations in question were sourced from iNaturalist itself, and also,
the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/52676-Pentagramma-triangularis">taxon record itself</a> is still in place, marked
as valid, and still has the same id number of 52676. So what on earth has happened?</p>
<p>Looking at the trace of the underlying API call to iNaturalist&rsquo;s name resolver, the plot thickens:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This shows a (tidied) rendition of the response to iNaturalist&rsquo;s <code>autocomplete</code> API, one of a few routes
it has for looking up taxa by name. Note the use of the &ldquo;phylum hack&rdquo; of priming the query to only look
within vascular plants with <code>phylum=Tracheophyta</code>. This reflects some experience on finding that the name of
taxa are far from unique, especially if what one is looking up is a bare genus name. For example, the name <em>Porella</em>
matches not only a <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/55250-Porella">quite popular liverwort</a> but a
<a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/taxa/627210-Porella">fairly unpopular bryozoan</a>. I was quite surprised when I found this,
but there are only so many names in the world and one can&rsquo;t expect naturalists divided by huge disciplinary
boundaries to avoid treading on each other&rsquo;s toes. Choosing the phylum level seems like a good compromise between
a level that one should be able to easily determine based on the context of a project, and not being too coarse to
permit too many false matches.</p>
<p>In any case, the transcript above shows that something quite unfortunate has happened – despite <em>Pentagramma triangularis</em>
still being a valid taxon itself, and the one we had previously recorded, it is no longer being returned by the API.
This is likely because all of its observations have now been divided up amongst its newly characterised subspecies.
Most of these have gone to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies#Nominotypical_subspecies_and_subspecies_autonyms">nominate subspecies</a>
<em>Pentagramma triangularis triangularis</em> which is likely the one we want to return. But what has happened in own
own API code that led us to now return nothing at all? Turns out to be an unfortunate interaction of assumptions.</p>

phylum check otherwise the rest of the system isn&rsquo;t going to believe in it. We juggle the flags around a bit like this:</p>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    if (query.phylum &amp;&amp; (score &amp; (512 | 256))) {
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This isn&rsquo;t brilliant – we&rsquo;re relying on the assumption that the more popular taxon is going to be returned first,
which seems justified by the decreasing observation count in the API response but we should really disambiguate this
ourselves, but it gets out of the hole we&rsquo;re in, in having to spend an hour or so of engineering effort on what
should have been a few minutes quick fix of an image URL.</p>
<h4 id="commentary">Commentary</h4>
<p>I wrote this up because I think the situation is interesting from a few points of view. To start with, the whole
ontological issue of multiplicity – the reassignment of one entity to two
(<em>Pentagramma triangularis</em> -&gt; <em>Pentagramma triangularis triangularis</em> + <em>Pentagramma triangularis semipallida</em>) is exactly
the kind of ontological hazard I wrote about in my <a href="https://www.shift-society.org/salon/papers/2018/critiques/critique-semprola.pdf">critique of Oli Sharpe&rsquo;s Semprola system</a>
in 2018. A mismatch in perceived multiplicity is perhaps the most problematic mismatch
there can be between different authors looking at the same system, and one which artefacts created by technologists
tend to handle very poorly. Someone looking at the world from the lens of a rigid &ldquo;type system&rdquo; is likely to neglect such
problems completely.</p>
<p>Secondly, this situation is interesting from the point of view of the meaning and function of the code which has been
written. When I was visiting <a href="https://ppig.org/workshops/2024-annual-workshop/">PPIG 2024</a> I got into conversation with
a naive person who believed that the task of automated translation of large bodies of code from one language/platform
to another was straightforward because all one needed to do was &ldquo;derive the specification of the code&rdquo; and then
translate according to that. But where is the specification of this code? Instead, it embodies a relation which has
only emerged interactionally with a particular external system and its ontology, from the point of view of the needs
of a particular community. This relation is also contingent and fragile – this site is likely to be patched again
before long, as ontological plates continue to shift, but as it stands it represents a kind of embodied knowledge<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
that needs to be treated with caution. I see this an example of Peter Wegner&rsquo;s 1997 thesis,
that <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/253769.253801">interaction is more powerful than algorithms</a> – whilst we have
what looks like an algorithm here, it is really only a contingent expression of the state of a particular
community interaction at a particular moment. Long ago,
<a href="https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Courses/Western_Washington_University/Political_Science_Theory_(Hsueh_and_Deylami)/01%3A_Readings/1.14%3A_Edmund_Burke__Excerpts_from_Reflections_on_the_Revolution_in_France_1790">Burke</a>
urged the value of epistemological caution in
tinkering with things that require &ldquo;even more experience than any person can gain in his whole life&rdquo; and
&ldquo;pulling down an edifice which has answered in any tolerable degree for ages the common purposes of society&rdquo;
and I see this situation as a small microscosm of a kind of Burkean caution<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkDqadw-fJE">Ian Shapiro</a> gives a fine introduction to this thought as part of the Yale
Moral Foundations of Politics course.</p>
<p>Anyway, there it is, we live to fight another day – and with every interaction with an external API comes a tussle of this
kind, for example, the <a href="https://github.com/IMERSS/pnw-bryo-atlas/blob/main/js/query-gbif-api.js#L29-L94">similar but distinct tussle</a>
with the <a href="https://www.gbif.org/">GBIF</a> taxon API which has its own discontents.</p>
