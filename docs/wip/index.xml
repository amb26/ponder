      <description>I get to staring at the markup templates that were already implemented for the Galiano 2023 Bioblitz and thinking how to adapt/reuse them for the upcoming Diatoms of the Salish Sea viz forces me to put some things in focus about how templating is going to have to work for these communities. I&amp;rsquo;d vaguely hoped that the details of how Infusion templating was going to interact with Hugo templating would somehow just &amp;ldquo;come out in the wash&amp;rdquo; but naturally this isn&amp;rsquo;t going to happen without some kind of focused plan!</description>

      <description>The substrate&amp;rsquo;s transition to editability will need to present a &amp;ldquo;mostly rendered&amp;rdquo; view of itself – managed by some form of rich text editor. A huge &amp;ldquo;grab-bag list&amp;rdquo; is at JefMari&amp;rsquo;s curated list of Awesome Wysiwyg Editors which can rapidly be whittled down to a shortlist. CKEditor 5 and TinyMCE are familiar from decades ago. But the gold standard is clearly Marijn&amp;rsquo;s ProseMirror – basic example here and really nice markdown editing example here.</description>
