        <p><a href="https://github.com/munificent/ui-as-code">UI as Code</a> as a named slogan originated in the context of Dart&rsquo;s Flutter UI toolkit
created by Google.
It is centrally described by Bob Nystrom in this thoughtful posting
<a href="https://medium.com/dartlang/making-dart-a-better-language-for-ui-f1ccaf9f546c">Marking Dart a Better Language for UI</a>.
I see it as part of a wider trend in many environments to express designs in general-purpose programming language code rather than configuration languages with
less expressive power. For example, ESLint&rsquo;s
<a href="https://eslint.org/blog/2022/08/new-config-system-part-2/">flat config</a> system introduced in 2022 moves its previous JSON-based
linting configuration into JavaScript code.</p>
<p>Moves towards expression in code bring several advantages, of kinds discussed by Gilad Bracha in his
2014 posting <a href="https://gbracha.blogspot.com/2014/09/a-domain-of-shadows.html">A DOMain of Shadows</a>. Configuration languages as they
grow in complexity tend to evolve into &ldquo;shadow domains&rdquo; aping various constructs from programming languages, typically
with inferior usability and regularity to the &ldquo;real&rdquo; (as Gilad calls them) programming language constructs which they are shadowing.</p>
<p>Bob discusses a number of powerful patterns for capturing various kinds of UI variations succinctly as programming
language syntax in his <a href="https://medium.com/dartlang/making-dart-a-better-language-for-ui-f1ccaf9f546c">posting</a>. By aiding readability
and concision these can helpfully close up the gap between design and expression and greatly increase the efficiency of UI developers.</p>
<h3 id="ui-as-code-harbours-assumptions">UI as code harbours assumptions</h3>
<p>I feel that the &ldquo;X as Code&rdquo; initiatives encode a number of assumptions about the development process,
the relationships between users and developers and the ways they are embedded in community and economic structures that
may not always be justified. These assumptions are rarely clearly articulated and may not always hold.</p>
<p>To explore these assumptions I want to take a little journey through a seemingly innocuous UI improvement I was recently
tasked with.</p>
<h3 id="a-very-innocuous-seeming-design-change">A very innocuous-seeming design change</h3>
<p>On the face of it, the task is extremely simple. <a href="http://www.danaayotte.com/">Dana Ayotte</a>, our UX designer on the
<a href="https://imerss.github.io/xetthecum-storymap/">Xetthecum ecocultural mapping project</a>,
noticed that the brown underline bar was
<a href="https://github.com/IMERSS/xetthecum-storymap/issues/34">not appearing consistently</a> on subpages of our nav bar,
now that several of them had submenus. The screenshot below shows the desired UI state, with the &ldquo;About&rdquo; menu link
highlighted, even though the overall page navigation is to a page on the submenu, &ldquo;About the Project&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/xetthecum-menu-highlight.jpg" alt="Xetthecum project menu highlight"></p>
<p>This menubar turns out to be a component rendered as part of the <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> publishing system,
a prominent platform in the R language ecosystem that many of our colleagues in <a href="https://imerss.org/">IMERSS</a> are
well versed in. Quarto uses an interesting architecture where a captive instance of <a href="https://deno.com/">Deno</a>, a JavaScript
runtime, is used to produce a server-side DOM using a TypeScript plugin architecture, whose markup is then woven (&ldquo;knitted&rdquo;)
together with output from <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R markdown</a>&rsquo;s standard document publication chain based on
pandoc, a very popular document converter written in Haskell. Quite the polyglot system, some of which is helpfully
sketched out in this Stack Overflow <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/40563480/1381443">answer</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the relevant piece of code producing the <code>nav-link</code> nodes in the dropdown is part of the TypeScript
implementation of Quarto&rsquo;s <code>navigation</code> component embedded in its `website&rsquo; project type,
held <a href="https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/project/types/website/website-navigation.ts#L552-L569">here in GitHub</a>.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is a 16-line snippet from the 1600 line file <a href="https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/project/types/website/website-navigation.ts"><code>website-navigation.ts</code></a>.</p>
<p>It clearly seems prohibitive to fork the entire file (or indeed, possibly the entire project type) in order to insert
our tiny tweak to this rendering logic. Before we decide on a strategy, it&rsquo;s worth taking a couple of steps back to
determine how we even got this far.</p>
<h3 id="jungle-dom-skills">Jungle DOM skills</h3>
<p>Faced with the raw feature request, directing us at some bit of the app&rsquo;s UI, our task is to figure out which bit of
the implementation produces it. All things being equal<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, in an &ldquo;X as Code&rdquo; paradigm the relationship between algorithm
and output is going to be pretty opaque, but thankfully given the output being in the DOM in a web browser right
in front of us we have incontestable and immediate access to its structure via the DOM inspector, a kind of tool
which is mature, stable and ubiquitous. Here&rsquo;s a snapshot of the DOM surrounding our link of interest:</p>
<p><img src="../../img/xetthecum-inspector.png" alt="DOM inspector view of navigation link"></p>
<p>Our &ldquo;jungle skills&rdquo; direct us to look for plausible landmarks and then see if raw text searching will help us locate
matching bits of implementation in the source code<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. This directs our attention to the <code>nav-link</code> CSS class which
indeed occurs in only a few places in the quarto codebase, quickly narrowed down to the site above.</p>
<p>In this case we&rsquo;ve been saved by quite a few aspects of openness and malleability built into typical (but not all) patterns
of web development. Firstly, the CSS class names were highly <em>readable</em>, which can&rsquo;t be taken for granted in highly
optimised CSS build systems such as used in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/css-modules-part-1-need/">CSS modules</a>, resulting in the kind of
&ldquo;div soup&rdquo; reported in <a href="https://css-tricks.com/twitters-div-soup-and-uglyfied-css-explained/">Twitter&rsquo;s rendered markup</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, the source code was provided for the underlying framework (Quarto) and it consisted of DOM manipulation as
would have been done on the client, expressed against a server DOM, and thirdly, we have the ubiquitous DOM inspector to help us out.</p>
<h3 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h3>
<p>Putting all of these aspects together gives us a clear route to a wholly acceptable fix by injecting a
<a href="https://github.com/IMERSS/xetthecum-storymap/blob/main/docs/js/fix-nav.js">small snippet</a> of
plain JavaScript code which executes as the page starts up, navigating to the same landmarks in the DOM, correlating
the structure of different parts of the page together and matching the actions of the server DOM manipulation:</p>

final essential aspect of openness of the web platform, that is not achievable under a &ldquo;UI as Code&rdquo; idiom. The performance
of the resulting system isn&rsquo;t quite as good as one which rendered during the build, but in practice Quarto does a fair-bit
of load-time DOM manipulation itself and the additional overhead is wholly unnoticeable.</p>
<h3 id="what-does-ui-as-code-assume">What does UI as Code assume?</h3>
<p>Our journey was awkward and only had a reasonable ending because of values baked into the Web and its idioms by Sir Tim
and his successors decades before the current wave of &ldquo;UI as Code&rdquo; started to break.</p>
<p>We can unpack some assumptions of &ldquo;UI as Code&rdquo; as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is an authoritative, final design for the application provided to a developer/team who has a single point of control
over the delivered product</li>
<li>Our task is to maximise the expressive power (ability to express design in a maximally readable way with least typing
and cognitive load) of that developer/team</li>
</ul>
<p>These assumptions are true for a broad range of development scenarios but not the ones I am interested in. I am interested
in the problem of how communities with overlapping but not precisely aligned interests can effectively own and adopt
technologies without incurring unaffordable costs. The cost of forking or otherwise &ldquo;vendoring&rdquo; a 1600 line TypeScript
implementation to make a tiny UI tweak lies clearly in the &ldquo;unaffordable&rdquo; camp. One could argue that the Quarto team
did not follow &ldquo;industry best practices&rdquo; and could/should have organised their code into smaller/more focused units, but
I don&rsquo;t buy that. Quarto is one of the better organised codebases I&rsquo;ve seen, and the developers have gone to some lengths
to ensure that some kind of plugin architecture does exist
(which for example is <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/plugin@master#hdr-Warnings">not supported</a> by Hugo, the UI generator for this site).
The use of TypeScript plus server-side DOM manipulation is a middle-of-the-road, conservative strategy which guarantees that
the markup pipeline is maximally intelligible to people with eyeballs, if not to any tooling or inference.
The problem as I see it is that opacity &mdash; the inability to trace results back to causes &mdash; is built in to the
programming languages and tooling that we have built up in the last decades, and it is only rather anomalous (and widely
derided) platforms such as the Web have sufficient malleability built in to mitigate this.</p>
<h3 id="building-a-substrate">Building a Substrate</h3>
<p>Over the next months and years I will be writing about my work building Infusion, a <em>substrate</em> for programming, inspired by the
values of the Web, which aims to make problems of malleability which are easy to express, easy to solve by means of
tools delivered along with apps themselves.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Flutter itself is also provided with a highly capable <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/tools/devtools/inspector">visual inspector</a>
tool delivered as part of its DevTools - but these tools are naturally not delivered wherever an app is delivered, and
require it to be started in a special way.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Very similar jungle skills have had to be deployed developing the <a href="https://gohugo.io/templates/partial/">Hugo template structure</a>
