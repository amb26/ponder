        <p>Or – &ldquo;Evading Gilad&rsquo;s Comparison&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A 2014 posting of Gilad Bracha&rsquo;s, <a href="https://gbracha.blogspot.com/2014/09/a-domain-of-shadows.html">A DOMain of shadows</a>,
has prompted a lot of thought over the years. I refer to it in passing in last month&rsquo;s
<a href="../../post/2025-03-20-ui-as-code">On UI as Code</a> but this week a line of argument became a bit clearer on how
the comparison in the posting might be dodged.</p>
<p>Gilad&rsquo;s note is about the design tension constantly pushing complexity into any purportedly &ldquo;simple&rdquo; user-facing language,
that we might call a DSL. He argues that any DSL is constantly under pressure to become a general-purpose computing
language, since if it does not, it ends up evolving &ldquo;shadow constructs&rdquo; which ape those which are more competently
implemented in such a language. If his argument can&rsquo;t be counterbalanced, the &ldquo;UI as code&rdquo; idiom pushed by Flutter etc.
must be accepted, along with the tool chains and social constructs that come with it. However, at a practical level,
<a href="../../post/2025-03-20-ui-as-code">my posting</a> shows the kinds of consequences that we typically have to accept with such a choice.</p>
<p>But to go along with this practical demonstration, how can we evade the criticism at a moral level? Gilad&rsquo;s second example
is of a view templating language, Polymer – it is a thing of its day, but every view templating system is forced
into similar choices. For example, Vue&rsquo;s <a href="https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/list.html">list rendering template syntax</a>
(one has to say, a highly successful one) duly includes &ldquo;shadow constructs&rdquo; for looping and conditionals. A fully
fledged &ldquo;shadom domain&rdquo; that should be better implemented in code? Maybe.</p>
<p>From my point of view what is problematic about these shadow domains is not just that they ape constructs in general-purpose
programming language, but that they are just as opaque as them. For example, here is a section of templating language
from the Hugo theme underlying this site (earlier version of <a href="https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo/blob/master/layouts/partials/nav.html">Beautiful Hugo&rsquo;s nav.html</a>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">  &lt;div class=&#34;{{ .Type }}-heading&#34;&gt;

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Whether or not you consider this template would better have been implemented
in a general-purpose programming language, it is pretty hard to discover, given the rendered markup in the UI,
how it got there. Have a look in this page&rsquo;s markup and see how easily it leaps out at you – bearing in mind
that we are aiming here at a system which brings computation to the general public.</p>
<p>This is the same argument with the same consequences as in <a href="../../post/2025-03-20-ui-as-code">On UI as Code</a>.</p>
<p>Now, given that Infusion now implements what look like the same constructs <code>@for</code> and <code>@if</code>
in the view/configuration layer, how do we evade the &ldquo;shadow domain&rdquo; criticism?</p>
<h3 id="this-is-not-control-flow">This is not control flow</h3>
<p>One answer is that, despite their superficial resemblance, these are not control flow constructs. Rather than,
for example, <code>@for</code> being a looping construct, it is actually a construct that <em>puts one part of the system in
correspondence with another</em>. It says – &ldquo;There are as many components here as there are elements in this
data structure&rdquo;. Similarly, <code>@if</code> puts a component in correspondence with a reactive boolean value.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the &ldquo;base language&rdquo; which may or may not underlie the substrate, there may indeed be an <code>if</code> statement
which produced the boolean we are corresponding with – but maybe there isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Philosophically then there are not two or more &ldquo;shadow constructs&rdquo; here, there is just one, the &ldquo;put into correspondence&rdquo;
construct, which just has two syntactically different sugars reflecting whether the corresponding item is a composite
or a boolean. &ldquo;Old Infusion&rdquo; was a little clearer about this, with the configuration named
<a href="https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/SubcomponentDeclaration#dynamic-subcomponents-with-a-source-array">source/sources</a>
rather than <code>if/for</code> but there is no point confounding users with unfamiliar names for potentially familiar things.</p>
<p>A valid response to this distinction is &ldquo;at the end of the day it&rsquo;s the same thing – the same computation is
designated and occurs&rdquo; but I consider the difference of emphasis is important.
The operation of &ldquo;putting into correspondence&rdquo; plans for the
relationship to be maintained, and also to be traceable in either direction. It is this which will be at the
heart of Infusion&rsquo;s ability to trace causes from effects, and given a piece of UI, allow a UI gesture which
directly navigates to the pieces of data and code responsible.</p>
<h3 id="the-new-paradigm-is-an-old-paradigm">The new paradigm is an old paradigm</h3>
<p>As it turns out, as we are announcing &ldquo;the death of the execution paradigm&rdquo;, the alternative we are looking at is far
from a new one. It is in fact closely reminiscent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra">relational algebra</a>
underlying the highly successful SQL query model.
Codd introduced this model in his <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf">1970 paper</a>, and it is a close
match for our requirements – as befits an inhabitant of an <a href="../../term/integration-domain">integration domain</a> it is
not Turing complete and allows for the expression of what we call <a href="../../term/a-good-function">good functions</a> whose work
does not grow faster than the structural size of its arguments. The wrinkle in our formulation is that the entities
being related are part of different domains – whilst Codd&rsquo;s algebra relates data-to-data, ours relates data-to-substrate.
One can perhaps draw a lesson on the uphill struggle that faces this model from the fact I considered Codd&rsquo;s laws
far and away the most boring part of my Computer Science syllabus. Like the rest of the industry, I was computation-mad
and only wanted stuff that gave me more power rather than less.</p>
<p>Whilst it is colloquially true that &ldquo;an SQL query executes&rdquo; – one sees data centres grinding, and power being
dissipated – technically speaking it does not. It merely establishes a relation.</p>
