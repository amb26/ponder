        <p>A recent posting
<a href="https://dev.to/holasoymalva/why-the-latest-javascript-frameworks-are-a-waste-of-time-52pc">Why the Latest JavaScript Frameworks Are a Waste of Time</a>
sparks a short train of thought. As well as the characteristically disrespectful tone of discussion that technical
people often adopt, and the suggestion, contrary to my speculations looking at
<a href="../../post/2025-02-07-benchmarking-dom-reconciliation">DOM reconciliation</a>, that people really do use low-level benchmarks
when choosing frameworks, is the notion of frameworks contributing to development speed. One commentor invites us to watch
him against the clock to implement a front end in Svelte rather than React.</p>
<p>Whilst I don&rsquo;t doubt the reality that some frameworks, to some people, are likely to be much more productive
than others, this discussion to me ignores a reality is only heightened by the intrusion of AI into coding.
<a href="https://colinclark.org/">Colin Clark</a>
remarked to me last week, during his exciting residency at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob%27s_Pillow">Jacob&rsquo;s Pillow</a>
about his and his colleagues&rsquo; experiences of coding with AI,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;You go extremely fast, then suddenly you are completely unable to go at all&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Short-run coding speed in essentially any popular framework is shortly, if not already, essentially infinite since
an AI co-pilot will generate substantial implementations on the spot. A more pertinent question is what risks are being
stored up as designs become larger and older – these are necessarily hard to quantify since they refer to &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_risk">tail risks</a>&rdquo;
that may not come to fruition over the lifetime of a project. But the question is – how likely is it that a design
is steered to a point where it becomes essentially unnavigable as a result of inability to connect design changes
predictably with consequences?</p>
<!-- Find a link about how AI generated code is hard to maintain, and also AI is bad at maintenance -->
<p>There are a few kinds of responses to such tail risks. One is to avoid frameworks and focus on relatively transparent
environments such as C, as recommended by
<a href="http://www.codersnotes.com/notes/learning-via-bullshit/">Richard Mitton commenting on a Vyacheslav Egorov talk</a>. In these
environments there is a relatively direct connection between expressions (source code) and results (in this case
represented by emitted assembler). I am interested to see if these extremes can be harmonised – whether there
could be kinds of frameworks or <a href="../../term/substrate">substrates</a> which allow for a more direct correspondence between
expressions and results in the space of user interface – in particular, which allow the full train of design
decisions leading to a particular interface element being a certain way to be traced back to their original
expressions from the interface itself. We have a precedent for such systems inside the powerful CSS inspectors
now built into every mainstream browser.</p>
<p>Such a system will be helpful for human and AI coders alike – since easy access to the textual form of the
relevant design expression in a system gives a purchase point to an AI copilot just as readily as it does to a human
typist. This guards against the risk that systems become unnavigable as a result of the <em>context</em> of a design
element becoming unmanageably large. An AI coder is limited by the context required to understand a UI behaviour,
and opacity linking effects with causes, in the same way as a human.</p>
