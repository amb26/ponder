  Since 2017 I have been Biodiversity Informatics lead for <a href="https://imerss.org/">IMERSS</a>, the 
  Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological Research in the Salish Sea. I have been working to help communities
  with different models for knowledge &mdash; expert naturalists, citizen scientists, and Indigenous individuals and
  others &mdash; respectfully cooperate to share their knowledge of the natural world and be empowered
  as stewards of their natural environment. Some visualisations I've produced can be seen on the IMERSS
  <a href="https://imerss.github.io/imerss-bioinfo/">portal</a>.

The <a href="https://malleable.systems/">Malleable Systems Collective</a> believes, as I do, that it should be as easy
to change software as it is to use it. We believe in widening the circle of those empowered to make decisions about
their own technology, through making it as easy as possible to understand and change it.

Since 2022 I have worked for the 
<a href="https://agsci.oregonstate.edu/bee-atlas">Oregon Bee Atlas</a> to help landowners understand plant-pollinator
interactions and guide their land use decisions including evaluation of seed mixes, as well as supporting their
volunteers' observation work. I have implemented the 
<a href="https://oregon-bee-project.github.io/melittoflora/viz.html">Melittoflora</a> tool using a provisional version 
of the [Infusion](/infusion) framework which filters the project's data on wild bees by geographical, temporal and taxonomic filters and 
visualises the resulting interactions as a live, attractive bipartite ribbon graph.

Since 2008 I have been the lead developer of the [Infusion](/infusion) framework, a JavaScript framework supporting
the development of flexible software. Versions 1 through 4 of Infusion were relatively conventionally structured libraries supporting the development
of various UI widgets. Since 2024 a [comprehensive rewrite](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-6) of Infusion has been underway for version 6
based on reactive primitives throughout, structuring it as a [software substrate](/terms/substrate) constituting
an [integration domain](/terms/integration-domain).
