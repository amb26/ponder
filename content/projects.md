Since 2022 I have worked for the 
<a href="https://agsci.oregonstate.edu/bee-atlas">Oregon Bee Atlas</a> to help landowners understand plant-pollinator
interactions and guide their land use decisions including evaluation of seed mixes, as well as supporting their
volunteers' observation work. I have implemented the 
<a href="https://oregon-bee-project.github.io/melittoflora/viz.html">Melittoflora</a> tool using a provisional version 
of the [Infusion](/infusion) framework which filters the project's data on wild bees by geographical, temporal and taxonomic filters and 
visualises the resulting interactions as a live, attractive bipartite ribbon graph.

Since 2008 I have been the lead developer of the [Infusion](/infusion) framework, a JavaScript framework supporting
the development of flexible software. Versions 1 through 4 of Infusion were relatively conventionally structured libraries supporting the development
of various UI widgets. Since 2024 a [comprehensive rewrite](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-6) of Infusion has been underway for version 6
based on reactive primitives throughout, structuring it as a [software substrate](/terms/substrate) constituting
an [integration domain](/terms/integration-domain).

In 2012 I was lucky enough to work with the late great <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/michael-eisenberg">Mike Eisenberg</a>
to produce an incarnation of Hal Abelson and Andy diSessa's 
<a href="https://direct.mit.edu/books/oa-monograph/4663/chapter/213442/Turtle-Escapes-the-Plane">spherical turtle concept</a> 
to run on NOAA's <a href="https://sos.noaa.gov/">Science on a Sphere</a> planetarium system. I wrote WebGL 
<a href="https://github.com/Math-on-a-Sphere/Math-on-a-Sphere/blob/master/MathClient/src/main/webapp/shaders/generalPolygon.c">shader code</a> to rasterise
spherical polygons into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection">ECE projection system</a> accepted by the projectors and worked on a Logo-like language to invoke it. You can
try out an <a href="/weblogo/client.html">in-browser implementation of WebLogo here</a>.

From 2010 to 2020 I was core framework architect for the <a href="https://gpii.net/">GPII</a> 
(now <a href="https://morphic.org/">Morphic</a>), an autopersonalization project aiming to automatically adapt technology to meet the 
needs and preferences of users. A description of our architecture and goals appeared in a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-07509-9_35">HCI 2014 paper</a>.

Early deployments of the RSF framework were the twinned <a href="https://darwin-online.org.uk">Darwin Online</a> and
<a href="https://wallace-online.org/">Wallace Online</a> projects. Darwin Online is the world's largest resource on Charles Darwin
and has served over a billion documents since being deployed in 2006, despite not receiving external funding since 2008 
(when the codebase was last updated). It exemplifies the "plain documents" ethic of our movement and is managed via CSV files and HTML exports from DreamWeaver
rather than a heavyweight CMS.

My first outing in the space of web technologies, <a href="https://rsf.github.io/wiki/Wikib2ab.html?page=Main">RSF</a>
(2005-2008) was an unusual kind of Java framework which developed a dialect 
of <a href="https://rsf.github.io/wiki/Wikicce8.html?page=PureXHTMLTemplating">logic-free HTML templates</a> against a backend
of demand-driven dataflow defined in the
<a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html">Spring configuration format</a>.
The intention was to leverage the then-prevalent ecosystem of plain HTML authoring tools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Dreamweaver">Dreamweaver</a>
in a strategy whose faults are written up in my 2021 PPIG paper on <a href="https://ppig.org/files/2021-PPIG-32nd-basman.pdf">Markup-driven polymorphism</a>.
