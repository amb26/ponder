  Since 2017 I have been Biodiversity Informatics lead for <a href="https://imerss.org/">IMERSS</a>, the 
  Institute for Multidisciplinary Ecological Research in the Salish Sea. I have been working to help communities
  with different models for knowledge &mdash; expert naturalists, citizen scientists, and Indigenous individuals and
  others &mdash; respectfully cooperate to share their knowledge of the natural world and be empowered
  as stewards of their natural environment. Some visualisations I've produced can be seen on the IMERSS
  <a href="https://imerss.github.io/imerss-bioinfo/">portal</a>.

The <a href="https://malleable.systems/">Malleable Systems Collective</a> believes, as I do, that it should be as easy
to change software as it is to use it. We believe in widening the circle of those empowered to make decisions about
their own technology, through making it as easy as possible to understand and change it.</a>

Between 2022 and 2024 I was a Solutions Network Member for CIFAR's 
<a href="https://cifar.ca/ai/ai-and-society/cifar-solution-networks/data-communities-for-inclusion/">Data Communities for Inclusion</a>
project, finding ways that self-employed women in India's SEWA cooperatives could effectively own their own 
technological platforms. I developed a very low-cost spreadsheet-driven e-commerce platform for
<a href="https://datacommunities.ca/toolkit/sewa-saamarth-app/">SEWA Saamarth</a> that allowed the members to advertise and sell vegetable products within the Federation.

I am affiliated with <a href="https://lichen.coop/">Lichen Community Systems</a>, a Canada-based worker-led cooperative building technologies to support the arts, disability
and, non-profit and cooperative communities. Under this umbrella I have issued a manifesto for 
<a href="https://lichen-community-systems.github.io/knitting-data-communities/">Knitting Data Communities</a> promoting an
ethic for groups of overlapping communities sharing data that concerns them.

<a href="https://boxer-project.github.io">Boxer</a> is a highly interesting and ancient programming system which
closely conforms to Jonathan Edwards' definition of a <a href="/term/substrate">substrate</a>. In 2022 I chaired the 
2nd international workshop dedicated to Boxer in the form of the 
<a href="https://2022.programming-conference.org/home/salon-2022">Boxer Salon</a> hosted at <a href="https://2022.programming-conference.org/">
Programming 2022</a> at Porto. I also maintain a helpful <a href="https://boxer-project.github.io/boxer-literature/Thematic%20index/">index to the Boxer
literature</a>.
