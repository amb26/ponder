After training in mathematics at Cambridge University, I devolved firstly into a Computer Science Diploma and then
branched out into a PhD in Computer Vision at the Engineering Department's 
[Speech, Vision and Robotics group](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/Main/MiOverview).

After working in various startups in the Cambridge area I spent a while working at 
[CARET](http://web.archive.org/web/20080706064423/http://www.caret.cam.ac.uk/), 
the Centre for Applied Research in Educational Technologies.

Following that I spent 5 years as a Visiting Scholar at the 
[University of Colorado at Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/) as a guest of 
[Clayton Lewis](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/clayton-lewis).

Since then I have been at work on various malleable and community-oriented projects from my base in London, UK.
