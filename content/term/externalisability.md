Defined in my [2018 paper](/pdf/onward-2016.pdf), _externalisability_, together with its dual property of 
_addressibility_, represents an essential property of a [substrate](/term/substrate) supporting open authorship.
An externalisable design is one which is [serialisable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) in a form in
which every design element has more or less stable and legible coordinates. An addressible, externalised serialisation
of a design could be in terms of a JSON document with human-readable keys, to be contrasted with relatively opaque
kinds of serialisation such as Python's pickling or Java's object serialization systems, designed to round-trip
arbitrary in-memory structures allocated in a general-purpose programming language.
