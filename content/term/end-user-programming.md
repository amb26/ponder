[End-user programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_development) is a time-honoured discipline but end-user
tools such as spreadsheets are held in contempt by specialised developers. The discipline actively works to raise
barriers of abstraction and tooling to ensure that it is only accessible by specialists and what investment is made in
end-user tools is done under the assumption, like Gabriel's, that the gulf between those empowered to build software and
those empowered to use it will stay unbridgeable. A "macho intellectual culture" ensures that if a tool or process
can't be understood, it is the developer's challenge to understand it rather than the producer's challenge to make
it comprehensible.

Jonathan Edwards wrote an exciting blog posting in 2013 under the guise of a
[Leaked transcript of censored Bret Victor talk](https://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=797) and remarks on this tendency:

> a great way to make programming as hard as possible is to make it more like mathematics

A recent [Ink and Switch article](https://www.inkandswitch.com/end-user-programming/) on end user programming
rightly concludes that it remains "largely a dream".
