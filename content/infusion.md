Infusion, originally an initiative of the [Fluid community](https://fluidproject.org/) since 2008, is a JavaScript
library enabling the creation of flexible software. Versions 1 through 4 of Infusion, [documented](https://docs.fluidproject.org/infusion/development/) 
and hosted on the Fluid project's site, were relatively conventionally structured libraries supporting the development
of various UI widgets.

Since 2024 a [comprehensive rewrite](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-6) of Infusion has been underway for 
[version 6](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion-6) based on reactive primitives throughout, structuring it as
a [software substrate](/term/substrate) constituting an [integration domain](/term/integration-domain).

Here is a [short video](https://youtu.be/ai2fbWi3kUU) demonstrating the state of Infusion 6 as of July 2025.
